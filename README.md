# Youth Workshop: Teach the Future

These are shared notes I created from our group's conversation at the Teach the Future workshop at the Dubai Future Forum

We are discussing the present and future of goal-oriented AI systems design. We initially focused on education for children then ended up going broader with respect to AI perception and utilisation today and in the future.

## Introduction

We are a group exploring the design of goal-oriented AI systems that will incentivize better learning outcomes for the younger generation. We will talk about how we see the design of AI systems transitioning from the present to the future through a ClA analysis, casual layered analysis. it explores Headlines, Systems, Worldviews and metaphors of the present and future of that topic.

## What are the headlines?

### Present
The headlines around AI systems today may have a more negative lean:
- "AI is taking quality time away from children"
- "AI is increasing the digital divide"
- "AI algorithms are driving addiction to online content"
- "Question: Is AI a boon or a threat for humanity?"

But there is hope:
- AI is increasing access to differently abled populations

### Future

- Personalized AI agents are going to debate on our behalf online, and summarize all information for our consumption
- AI oriented education systems -- we will assist AI, instead of AI assisting us
- Students will create a sustainable society
- Bridging intergenerational divides: Children and elders are engaging in shared learning through effective knowledge transfer


## Systems

What are/will be the "systems" giving rise to these headlines?

### Present
Here are a few:

- Tech companies care about short-term profits above all
- Our current education systems are not equipped to deal with AI
- socioeconomic disparities affect access to technological progress
- schools lack funding to deploy AI tools to understand and drive impact on students
- Cheating is not encouraged

### Future
- Integrating multicultural learnings into AI systems for equitable outcomes and global impact
- Emotionally supportive communities for empathy-centered governance
- Global collaboration 
- Regulatory gains through specialized intelligent decision support systems
- More productive work is being done



## Worldviews
What are/will be the worldviews that have given rise to the systems?

### Present
- Easy Money
- Political correctness (how much is too much?)
- Influencing others
- Herd mentality 
- Skills are not the priority, money is what determines your success

### Future
- AI is a support system, it is not my life
- Controlled / regulated use of AI for positive societal impact
- Using AI to drive more technological innovation
- Increasing access to intercultural experiences

## Myths / Metaphors / Memes

Let's talk a bit about the myths, metaphors, and memes that we have about AI.

### Present
- AI will take away our jobs
- AI is the knight in shining armor
- AI will replace all of us
- AI is turning humans into data producing and data labeling machines
- AI replaces education systems like schools and in-person interactions are discouraged


### Future
- Techno-human Harmony: Ability to create equity and access to resources through AI
- AI will seamlessly blend with human lives
- AI will create more high-skilled jobs and eliminate more low-skilled jobs
- AI was just a bubble
- Interconnected ness and coexisting with healthy competition
